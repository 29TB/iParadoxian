Hello! I am src-ry. I am a student learning C/C++. I like making small little projects.

## About me
I support FOSS software, however do not mind using closed, proprietary software if it makes everyday tasks easier (thus why I use GitHub, it's helpful for developers and students).

## Projects
I am working on a few Wii hacks to help others to homebrew their Wii, as ewll as a few QOL channels for it, and some HBC projects. I plan on releasing a few Riivolution mods at some point as well.
