Hello! I am src-ry. I am a student learning C/C++, intermediate PHP knowledge and absolutely no SQL knowledge. I like making small little projects, but would like to move onto a larger project scaled with more people in mind. I am very interesed in the FOSS ecosystem, and have contributed to a few repositories, however, I am going to work on a few more open-source projects.

## About me
I support FOSS software, however do not mind using cloed, proprietary software if it makes everyday tasks easier (thus why I use GitHub, it's helpful for developers and students).

## Projects
I am working on 2 Minecraft utilities; one for Bedrock Edition, one for Java Edition. I also play around with wiki software, like MediaWiki and MoinMoin. 

## Contact me
You may contact me via e-mail at `believaboat@gmail.com`. I also go by `srcry` on `libera.chat`. However, I have left Discord due to issues in trust with the company/software.
